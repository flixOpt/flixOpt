# flixOpt: Energy and Material Flow Optimization Framework

**flixOpt** is a Python-based optimization framework designed to tackle energy and material flow problems using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Combining flexibility and efficiency, it provides a powerful platform for both dispatch and investment optimization challenges.

## 🚀 Introduction

flixOpt was developed by [TU Dresden](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden) as part of the SMARTBIOGRID project, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (FKZ: 03KB159B). Building on the Matlab-based flixOptMat framework (developed in the FAKS project), flixOpt also incorporates concepts from [oemof/solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph). 

Although flixOpt is in its early stages, it is fully functional and ready for experimentation. Feedback and collaboration are highly encouraged to help shape its future.

## 📦 Installation

Install flixOpt directly into your environment using pip. Thanks to [HiGHS](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS?tab=readme-ov-file), flixOpt can be used without further setup.
`pip install git+https://github.com/flixOpt/flixOpt.git`

We recommend installing flixOpt with additional dependencies for visualizing network graphs using pyvis:
`pip install "flixOpt[visualization] @ git+https://github.com/flixOpt/flixOpt.git"`

## 🌟 Key Features and Concepts

### 💡 High-level Interface...
  - flixOpt aims to provide a user-friendly interface for defining and solving energy systems, without sacrificing fine-grained control where necessary.
  - This is achieved through a high-level interface with many optional or default parameters.
  - The most important concepts are:
    - **FlowSystem**: Represents the System that is modeled.
    - **Flow**: A Flow represents a stream of matter or energy. In an Energy-System, it could be electricity [kW]
    - **Bus**: A Bus represents a balancing node in the Energy-System, typically connecting a demand to a supply.
    - **Component**: A Component is a physical entity that consumes or produces matter or energy. It can also transform matter or energy into other kinds of matter or energy.
    - **Effect**: Flows and Components can have Effects, related to their usage (or size). Common effects are *costs*, *CO2-emissions*, *primary-energy-demand* or *area-demand*. One Effect is used as the optimization target. The others can be constrained.
  - To simplify the modeling process, high-level **Components** (CHP, Boiler, Heat Pump, Cooling Tower, Storage, etc.) are availlable.

### 🎛️ ...with low-level control
- **Segmented Linear Correlations**  
  - Accurate modeling for efficiencies, investment effects, and sizes.
- **On/Off Variables**
  - Modeling On/Off-Variables and their constraints.
    - On-Hours/Off-Hours
    - Consecutive On-Hours/ Off-Hours
    - Switch On/Off

### 💰 Investment Optimization
- flixOpt combines dispatch optimization with investment optimization in one model.
- Size and/or discrete investment decisions can be modeled
- Investment decisions can be combined with Modeling On/Off-Variables and their constraints

### Further Features
- **Multiple Effects**
  - Couple effects (e.g., specific CO2 costs) and set constraints (e.g., max CO2 emissions).
  - Easily switch between optimization targets (e.g., minimize CO2 or costs).
  - This allows to solve questions like "How much does it cost to reduce CO2 emissions by 20%?"

- **Advanced Time Handling**
  - Non-equidistant timesteps supported.  
  - Energy prices or effects in general can always be defined per hour (or per MWh...)

  - A variety of predefined constraints for operational and investment optimization can be applied.
  - Many of these are optional and only applied when necessary, keeping the amount o variables and equations low.

## ⚙️ Calculation Modes

flixOpt offers three calculation modes, tailored to different performance and accuracy needs:

- **Full Mode**  
  - Provides exact solutions with high computational requirements.  
  - Recommended for detailed analyses and investment decision problems.

- **Segmented Mode**  
  - Solving a Model segmentwise, this mode can speed up the solving process for complex systems, while being fairly accurate.
  - Utilizes variable time overlap to improve accuracy.
  - Not suitable for large storage systems or investment decisions.

- **Aggregated Mode**  
  - Automatically generates typical periods using [TSAM](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam).  
  - Balances speed and accuracy, making it ideal for large-scale simulations.


## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Minimal coupling to Pyomo**
  - Included independent module is used to organize variables and equations, independently of a specific modeling language.
  - While currently only working with [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/), flixOpt is designed to work with different modeling languages with minor modifications ([cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org)).

- **File-based Post-Processing Unit**
  - Results are saved to .json and .yaml files for easy access and analysis anytime.
  - Internal plotting functions utilizing matplotlib, plotly and pandas simplify results visualization and reporting.

## 🛠️ Solver Integration

By default, flixOpt uses the open-source solver [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) which is installed by default. However, it is compatible with additional solvers such as:  

- [CBC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)  
- [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)  
- [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/)  
- [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer)

Executables can be found for example [here for CBC](https://portal.ampl.com/dl/open/cbc/) and [here for GLPK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/) (Windows: You have to put solver-executables to the PATH-variable)

For detailed licensing and installation instructions, refer to the respective solver documentation.
